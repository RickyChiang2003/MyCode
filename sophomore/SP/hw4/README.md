# SP2023_HW4_release

## Usage

Once you complete your `my_pool.c` and `my_pool.h` you can compile your program with `make` or `make all`. If you only want to compile the sample testcase, you can type `make sample` as you desired while using `make bench` for compile the benchmark program for your report.
