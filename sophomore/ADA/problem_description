Problem Discription: 

P1: Maximum Subarray
Input n and n integers, find Maximum Subarray.

P2: Edit Distance
Input string X, Y. Find the cost of transformation from X to Y. (transformation: 1.change X_i to c 2.erase X_i 3.insert c into X)

P3: Huffman Code
Input n as the size of a character set, and then input n integers f_0, f_1, ..., f_n, where f_i represents the frequency of occurence of the i'th character. Output n lines, i'th shows the encode of the i'th character. (need to implement prefix code so there won't exist any ambiguity)

P4: Strongly Connected Component
First line input n and m(vertices, edges). Next m lines input u,v (which means edge u->v). Output the number of vertex pair s.t.they are in SCC.

P5: Minimum Spanning Tree
First line input N, M(vertices, edges). Next M lines input a,b,c (which means edge a->b and weight c). Output the weight of the MST.(Using disjoint set with union by rank and path compression)

P6: MAX-3-CNF-SAT
I didn't finish it.

P7: A+B
No need to inform.
